Polaris is a web-based application designed for interactive team games, primarily scavenger hunts.
Participants navigate between locations using text or image clues and complete location-specific challenges, with
progress tracked via unique team links activated by QR codes.
It features easy configuration of teams, locations, hints, and challenges using CSV files, an optional general task
checklist, and a built-in tool to generate QR codes for game setup.
This flexibility makes Polaris highly adaptable for various events and settings.

## Setup and Configuration

Refer to the detailed [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) file for comprehensive instructions on configuring game resources (hints,
challenges, checklist, locations using CSV files) and customizing images (logo, favicon).

**Key Setup Points:**

- **CSV Files:** Game data (hints, challenges, locations, checklist) is managed via CSV files stored in the
  `assets/game/` directory.
  * Files must use **semicolon (;) separators**.
  * Team names and milestone names must be consistent across files.
  * Use `NULL` for empty fields where applicable.
- **Images:** Place custom `logo.svg` and `favicon.svg` in the `assets/game/` folder. Default Polaris logos will be used
  if these are missing.
- **Project Structure:** Follow the recommended project structure outlined in `SETUP.md`.

## Installation & Running

Polaris is a static web application.

1. **Dependencies:** While primarily static, the QR code generation feature utilizes client-side JavaScript libraries.
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed if you intend to modify or build the project using Vite.

* Run `npm install` to install development dependencies if needed.

2. **Build (Optional):** If modifications were made, you can build the project using `npm run build` (assuming a
   relevant script exists in `package.json` based on the `vite.config.js` setup).
3. **Hosting:** Host the entire project folder on any static web server (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Amazon S3,
   or a standard Apache/Nginx server).

## Game Flow

1. **Access the Game:** Players navigate to the hosted `index.html` page.
2. **Enter Team Name:** Players enter their designated team name to begin.
3. **Receive First Clue:** Upon starting, the first clue (and challenge, if applicable) is displayed.
4. **Navigate & Scan:** Players solve the clue, go to the location, and find the corresponding QR code. Scanning the QR
   code directs them to the next step in the game.
5. **View Hints:** At each correct location page, players click "View Hint" to get the clue/challenge for the next
   milestone.
6. **Checklist:** Players can optionally track non-location-specific tasks using the checklist drawer.
7. **Finish & Validate:** Upon reaching the final milestone link, players click "Validate Result" to see their
   completion status.

## QR Code Generation

1. Access the generator via the "Generate QR Codes" link on the main game page.
2. Upload a **semicolon-separated** CSV file containing location names (rows for teams, columns for milestones, matching
   other game files).
3. Enter the **Base URL** where the `index.html` file is hosted (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/polaris`) - **do not
   include a trailing slash**.
4. Click "Generate" to download a PDF containing QR codes for each location, labeled accordingly.
